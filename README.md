# Fortran-90
Transpose.f90 is a code I made to transpose rectangular matrices of numerical data from .txt files which I made upon writing an extensive code which outputs data to rows only to learn that Xmgr only reads data in columns. I annotated it for a friend who likes to enter a lot of input manually so that he could see examples of how not to.
